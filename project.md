title: The Project
---

The Diversity Meter project is driven by the trust in the power of dialogue. We believe that better journalism and more constructive public discourse can be supported by helping people listen to different viewpoints. 

At its core, the vision and aim behind the Diversity Meter is to support equal and just democracy.

The Diversity Meter team consists of active members of Sopiva (the Association for Conciliatory Journalists). The association develops new methods in journalism through research, experimentation and collaboration. 

Conciliatory Journalism makes use of methods of dialogue and mediation in order to do better journalism about conflict-prone and polarized topics. The aim is not consensus, but increased multi-voiced understanding. The idea was developed in an action research project in 2016-2018 (carried out by Tampere University’s Research Centre for Journalism, Media and Communication and funded by the Kone Foundation).


The Diversity Meter participated in a Finnish media innovation challenge ”Uutisraivaaja” in 2019. The Diversity Meter made it among the top five finalists, which provided the project valuable resources that boosted the project significantly forward.
